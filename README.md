# Open Source RAG ü§óü¶ú

## Here's how you upload your files and ask him questions with Python, Langchain and HuggingFace, free of charge!

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using user-uploaded PDF documents. The system allows the user to upload a PDF document and ask questions based on the content of the document. When a new PDF is uploaded, the system replaces the old document and recreates the vector database.

## Frameworks and libraries

* Langchain ü¶úüîó: the framework responsible for orchestrating our NLP tasks
* Hugging Face ü§ó: where the embedding model and LLM comes. We are using [bge-small-en](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en) to embedding and [zephyr-7b-alpha](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha) to LLM
* FAISS üìä: open-source vector database
* PyPDF üìÑ: to load the PDF files
* Streamlit üî¥: to view our application
* Docker üêã: containerize our system

## Ways to Use the Application 

In this tutorial, I'll show to ways to use the application: installing dependencies manually and using Docker

## 1. Installing Manually 

### 1.1 Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 version or higher
* Pip (Python package manager)

### 1.2 Installation 

Clone the repository to your local machine:
 
``` 
git clone https://github.com/arturgomesc/Open-Source-RAG.git
cd Open-Source-RAG
```

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

``` 
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # If you're using Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required dependencies:

``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Hugging Face token:

``` 
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=hf_xxx
```

### 1.3 Executing the Application

Initialize a CMD on the project and run:

``` 
streamlit run app.py
```


## 2. Running the Application with Docker

### 2.1. Prerequisites

* Docker installed on your machine.

## 2.2. Building and Running the Docker Container

Clone the Repository:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/arturgomesc/rag-open-source-system.git
cd rag-open-source-system
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Hugging Face token:

``` 
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=hf_xxx
```

Build the Docker image. In the directory where your Dockerfile is located, run the following command:

``` 
docker build -t rag-pdf-upload .
```

Run the Docker Container. After building the image, run the container with the following command:

``` 
docker run -p 8501:8501 --env HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=hf_xxx rag-pdf-upload
```


## Using the Applcation

You will be able to open a URL and see the this:

![initial screen](./img/img.png)

Upload your PDF file and wait until the success message

![sucess message](./img/img_1.png)

Now, you can make queries abbout your file! If you want to change the file, just upload other file and repeat the process

![query](./img/img_2.png)

And here is an Open Source RAG running in front of you!
